# Pickling and Error Handling

## Introduction
This week’s assignment included an open-ended exercise where I created a script that demonstrated how to pickle data, and how to perform error handling.  In order to do this, I created a program that asks the user for an ID number, and a first name, stored the data to a binary file, and then printed all of the data in the binary file to the user.  Understanding these skills was important because binary file sizes are much smaller and can speed up enterprise applications substantially. 

## Step 1: Read Data, Store in List
The main body of this program was only four lines, however it called functions that were previously defined in the script. This first executable line is below:   


## Step 2: Add User Input to List

## Step 3: Save the List to Binary File

## Step 4: Print Data to User

## Step 5: Running the Script

## Summary
Pickling data is a great way to store data as smaller files.  As programs and databases get very large, this might even be required in some cases.  I’ve learned the basics, but there is no doubt I need to continue researching everything that the ‘pickle’ module has to offer.  In addition, the use of error handling is a necessary part of well performing scripts.  Whenever a script deals with input/output, it runs the risk of the user creating an error.  Exceptions are a concept that I see myself working on for a long time because there seems to be an aspect of creativity involved.  Looking forward to building on these skills!
